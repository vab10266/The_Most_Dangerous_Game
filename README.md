# The_Most_Dangerous_Game
Video Game inspired by "The Most Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell

PVP Hunter vs Hunted
3 skills, class determined by choice of 2 skills. Simultaneously 
choose 1st skill; 2nd skill isn't revealed.

Hunter:
  All: Start with knife, pistol, map, can detect and 
  follow tracks, win-condition: kill hunted before time is out.
  
  Combat: Rifle
  Observant: Binoculars & vision of stealthed & traps as ability
  Tracker: Dogs to sniff out hunted, your path marked on map
  
  C&O:Binoc + Rifle = sniper w/ scope
  C&T: Dogs can attack
  O&T: Dogs track better (can hear)
  
  Tips: Advantage here should come from better combat abilities 
  and/or choosing when and how to approach fights. A methodical, 
  careful, but persistant approach should be key to catching your 
  prey in an error while avoiding finding yourself in an unfortunate 
  situaton. Remmber, man is the most dangerous game.
  
Hunted:
  All: Start with knife, get head start, win-condition: kill hunter 
  or survive until sunrise (20 real minutes)
  
  Combat: Start w/ pistol
  Trapper: Build traps
  Stealth: Ghillie Suit & leave fewer tracks ability
  
  C&T: 
  C&S: "Stalker"
  T&S: Lethal traps
  
  Tips: Advantage here should come from trickery, stealth and the element 
  of suprise. Collecting materials to gain an advantage while under 
  threat of being caught is key to success.
  
Starting the game:
  The prey must be given a head start, but that doesn't mean you have to wait around for them to finish. At the start of the game, the hunted will choose a random path on a map from a list of 3 options: fastest speed for maximum distance from the starting point, medium speed puts less distance between predator and prey, but collects some resources on the way, the last option takes time to leave misleading tracks or double back around to surprise the hunter when they aren't ready. All tracks start from the same point. This choice is not made known to the hunter and both parties are brought into the game. The hunter is brought in at the start of the path, and the hunted is brought in where the path they chose left off.
